## Executor Module
Allow for execution of arbitrary bytecode from approved members of a multisig, while restricting actual management of members and quorum. 

Can be used in conjunction with transaction guard or other modules to limit scope of transactions that can be done by the multisig.

Mostly code copied from the existing Safe contracts with minor modifications made where necessary. 

Built using Foundry, use at your own risk :).
